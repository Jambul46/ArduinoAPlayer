# ArduinoAPlayer
Parts needed for minimal build:
arduino with atmega328p (i use nano),
sd card reader adapter,
3 buttons
and 3.5 audio jack


ArduinoAPlayer:
Easy to build arduino WAV file player with many functions:
press next to move on another song or hold it for increase volume
same thing with back just in other way
maybe i'll try add hold pause for random song

ArduinoAPlayerFormatter:
Simple tool to convert mp3 to arduino supported WAV

Warning:if u use my gerbers for pcb the card reader MUST! be from bottom or upside down
see picture "myBuild" and also i has to be tilted little bit
