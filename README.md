# ArduinoAPlayer
!Only codeMK5 is supported by minimal build!
--------------------------------------------
Parts needed for minimal build:
arduino with atmega328p (i use nano),
ISP SD Card adapter,
3 buttons
and 3.5 audio jack or/and speaker.

for connections use SchematicMK2.

ArduinoAPlayer (codeMK5):

Easy to build arduino WAV file player with many functions:
press NEXT to move on another song or hold it for increase volume
same thing with BACK just in other way and pause.

ArduinoAPlayer (codeMK6):
Bigger challenge
Harder to build arduino WAV file player with many functions:
press NEXT to move on another song or hold it for increase volume
same thing with BACK just in other way and press pause to pause :)
or hold it to unmount the SD Card. Doesn't need to RESET when plugged back in
the player uses SD-IN/DETECT pin so it will load normally like you would RESET it.

ArduinoAPlayerFormatter:
Simple tool to convert mp3 to arduino supported WAV

Warning:if u use my MK2 gerbers for pcb the card reader MUST! be from bottom or upside down
see picture "myBuild Board MK2" and also it has to be tilted little bit.
